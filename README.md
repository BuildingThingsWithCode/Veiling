# Veiling

This was the graduation project when I finished my education at the Open Universiteit. The goal was to create a web application with a SQL database running on a Tomcat server.
The application needed to be sort of an eBay clone. A website where people could register, login and then bid on items or sell items. 
This project uses Java, JSP, Servlets, SQL.
